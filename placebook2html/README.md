# Placebook2html

(Hopefully) a coffeescript program to convert a Placebook download into an HTML file, most likely using HTML5 application cache for offline use.

## Usage

Development usage:

- download a `.placebook` file from the server (available as an option under `Actions` for your own published placebooks).
- unzip the placebook file.
- run `coffee placebook2html <PATH/TO/>data.json` on the extracted contents.

Status: just starting
